 
1.1.	Objective

The key objectives of this project are:
1.	To find out gaps in the existing work done for air-writing
2.	Comparing different algorithms to find the best suited for the purpose.
3.	Comparing the accuracy achieved on changing various hyper-parameters of the selected algorithm.
4.	After comparative study of the algorithms and hyper-parameters, building a model to achieve air-writing in the most efficient and cost effective way.

1.2.	Motivation

The world as we know is constantly making progress in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Image processing. 
Utilizing advancements for better cause is always the motive behind these developments. 
Our main motivation behind creating this project was that we dream about a future where soon holographic interfaces will be used 
instead of screens which we use now and writing on such screens will definitely done in air. An air writing interface which can 
detect what is being written on air and display it on the interface will be one among the basic commodities that such holographic 
interfaces should possess. This paper showcases a prototype which can detect the letters written on air and all the related studies 
that can improve the scope and development of this idea.

To Run:
1) use the devnagiri dataset to train the model, a new .h5 will be created in you system.
2) Replace the .h5 file with your .h5 file in the prediction code.
you are good to go.
